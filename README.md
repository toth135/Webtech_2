Please follow these steps to start the application!

1st: Start mongo db with the command 'mongod'.
     I was working on linux so in my case: 'Sudo systemctl start mongod' and 'mongo'

2nd: Create a local database with 'AssignmentDB' name.
     After that if we add a new item the collection will be generated automatically.

3rd: Navigate to Server directory and start the backend. 
     - 'npm install' for node modules 
     - 'node index.js' for starting the server

4th: Navigate to Angular directory and start the frontend.
     - 'npm install' for node modules 
     - 'ng serve' for starting the angular frontend 
     - Server will start at http://localhost:4200
     - Angular 5 application! 

5th: Login 
     username: admin,
     password: admin
